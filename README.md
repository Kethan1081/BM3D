# BM3D
Block matching 3D denoising algorithm implementation in MATLAB as part of the final project in CSE 509: Digital Video Processing at Arizona State University.

Important Phases:
1. Block Matching based on similarity and stack to form 3D block.
2. 3D Transfrom from spatial domain.
3. Hard Thresholding to remove basic noise.
4. Block matching on updated image to improve efficiency.
5. Weiner filtering on original image based on coordinates from block matching.
